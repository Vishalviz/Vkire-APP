- **Notifications**: Expo Notifications

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- Expo CLI (`npm install -g @expo/cli`)
- iOS Simulator (for iOS development) or Android Studio (for Android development)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd VKApp
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up Supabase**
   - Create a new project at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
   - Copy your project URL and anon key
   - Update `src/services/supabase.ts` with your credentials:
     ```typescript
     const supabaseUrl = 'YOUR_SUPABASE_URL';
     const supabaseAnonKey = 'YOUR_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY';
     ```

4. **Set up the database schema**
   - Run the SQL commands from `database/schema.sql` in your Supabase SQL editor
   - This will create all necessary tables for the app

5. **Configure payments (optional for MVP)**
   - Set up Stripe account and get publishable key
   - Set up Razorpay account and get key ID
   - Update `src/constants/index.ts` with your payment keys

6. **Start the development server**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

7. **Run on device/simulator**
   - Press `i` for iOS simulator
   - Press `a` for Android emulator
   - Scan QR code with Expo Go app on your phone

## Database Schema

The app uses the following main tables:

- `users` - User accounts and basic info
- `pro_profiles` - Professional creator profiles
- `packages` - Service packages offered by professionals
- `portfolio_posts` - Creator portfolio items
- `inquiries` - Customer inquiries to professionals
- `bookings` - Confirmed bookings

## Development Guidelines

### Code Style
- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Follow React Native best practices
- Use functional components with hooks
- Implement proper error handling
- Add loading states for async operations

### State Management
- Use React Context for global state (auth, user data)
- Use local state for component-specific data
- Consider Redux Toolkit for complex state management in future

### API Integration
- All database operations go through `DatabaseService`
- Use Supabase client for real-time features
- Implement proper error handling and loading states

## Deployment

### Mobile App Stores
1. **Build for production**
   ```bash
   expo build:android
   expo build:ios
   ```

2. **Submit to stores**
   - Follow Expo's guide for app store submission
   - Ensure all required assets and metadata are included

### Backend
- Supabase handles hosting and scaling automatically
- Configure production environment variables
- Set up proper security rules and RLS policies
