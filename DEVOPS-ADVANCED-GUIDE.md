---

## 🔒 **LEVEL 6: SECURITY & COMPLIANCE**

### **🔧 What You've Built:**

1. **OPA Gatekeeper Policies** (`security/opa-policies/`)
   - ✅ Container security policies
   - ✅ Resource limit enforcement
   - ✅ Non-root user requirements
   - ✅ Read-only root filesystem

### **🎓 Key Learning Concepts:**

- **Policy as Code**: Security policies defined in code
- **Admission Controllers**: Enforce policies at deployment time
- **Security Best Practices**: Defense in depth
- **Compliance**: Automated policy enforcement
